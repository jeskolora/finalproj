## We created a program that will allow non-Philly natives to learn and get accostumed to the Philly slang.
The program allows users to view some Philly terms, add terms that are not provided in the program and quiz the user's knowledge on Philly terms.When incorporating the user's input to the dictionary, we struggled with placing the key-value pair in the right order. When creating the nesting the if-elif-else statements. At first, we want to do app or website, but my partner and I struggled to start that due to technologic diffuclties. Also, we wanted to create an app similar to google translate but there were too many conditions and languages to consider.All in All, we hope out-of-state Temple students use this app to subtly learn the necessary slang.
